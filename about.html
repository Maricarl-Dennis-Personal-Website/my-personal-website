        <p>Creativity through songwriting nourishes my soul and my mind. I love the process of telling stories and expressing emotions through songwriting.
            I've written and produced songs for my personal projects and also for other people. I've released 2 EPs and several singles. I've also written curated songs from customer requests
            with a company called Songfinch. Music to me serves as as a cathartic release and a gift to encourage people tell their stories.

        <p>Rockclimbing at the gym is my kind of workout and play. 
            Although I wouldn't call myself an expert and just rockclimb 
            indoors for fun, I enjoy the mental and physical challenge of climbing.
            Visually evaluating a route, imagining how to climb each hold and actually 
            doing it is such a fun process. I experience healthy frustration that fuels 
            my determination when I fall and "fail." I also get to exercise my strength and 
            muscles along the way, without even thinking too much about it!
